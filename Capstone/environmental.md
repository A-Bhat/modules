Outdoor Air Quality in the United States
========================================

## Background







## Project

The goal of this project is to take the EPA's comprehensive database
of air pollution monitoring information and to tell a coherent story
about how outdoor air pollution has changed over time and space in the
United States. In this project you will examine a pair of "criteria
pollutants", which are air pollutants for which national ambient air
quality standards have been developed. The goal of the standards is to
set maximum levels at which the pollutants can be found in the
air. However, in many locations in the U.S. air pollution levels
exceed the standards and thus those locations are in "non-attainment".

The two pollutants that you will focus on in this project are O3 and NO2.


### Data

Data for outdoor air pollution monitoring is collected by the
Environmental Protection Agency and is made available through the
EPA's [Air Quality
System](http://www.epa.gov/ttn/airs/airsaqs/detaildata/downloadaqsdata.htm)
(AQS). We have mirrored the EPA's web site on Coursera so please DO
NOT download the data from the EPA site. You can download the data
from the Coursera site directly at [URL].
