## R Packages

- When you download R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN),
  you get that ``base" R system

- The base R system comes with basic functionality; implements the R language

- One reason R is so useful is the large collection of packages that
  extend the basic functionality of R

- R packages are developed and published by the larger R community

--- 

## Obtaining R Packages

- The primary location for obtaining R packages is
  [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org)

- For biological and biomedical applications, many packages are
  available from the [Bioconductor Project](http://bioconductor.org)

- There are over 4,000 packages on CRAN covering a wide range of topics

- A list of some topics is available through the [Task
  Views](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) link, which groups
  together many R packages related to a given topic

---

## Installing an R Package

- Packages can be installed with the `install.packages()`
  function in R

- To install a single package, pass the name of the lecture to the
  `install.packages()` function as the first argument

- The following the code installs the **slidify** package from CRAN

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("slidify")
```
---

## Installing an R Package

- You can install multiple R packages at once with a single call to
  `install.packages()`

- Place the names of the R packages in a character vector

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("slidify", "ggplot2", "devtools"))
```
