## A famous motivating example




<img class=center src=../../assets/img/galton.jpg height=150>

### (Perhaps surprisingly, this example is still relevant)

<img class=center src=../../assets/img/height.png height=150>

## Questions for this class

* Consider trying to answer the following kinds of questions:
  * To use the parents' heights to predict childrens' heights.
  * To try to find a parsimonious, easily describe mean 
    relationship between parent and children's heights.
  * To investigate the variation in childrens' heights that appears 
  unrelated to parents' heights (residual variation).
  * To quantify what impact genotype information has beyond parental height in explaining child height.
  * To figure out how/whether and what assumptions are needed to
    generalize findings beyond the data in question.  
* For this lecture in specific, we'll also talk about the following
  famous question.
  * Why do children of very tall parents tend to be 
    tall, but a little shorter than their parents and why children of very short parents tend to be short, but a little taller than their parents?

## Galton's Data

* Let's look at the data first, used by Francis Galton in 1885. 
* Galton was a statistician who invented the term and concepts
  of regression and correlation, founded the journal Biometrika,
  and was the cousin of Charles Darwin.
* You may need to run `install.packages("UsingR")` if the `UsingR` library is not installed.
* Let's look at the marginal (parents disregarding children and children disregarding parents) distributions first. 
  * Parent distribution is all heterosexual couples.
  * Correction for gender vi multiplying female heights by 1.08.
  * Overplotting is an issue from discretization.
