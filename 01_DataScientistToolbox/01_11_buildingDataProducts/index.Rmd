## What is Slidify?

- Slidify was created by [Ramnath Vaidyanathan](https://github.com/ramnathv) in order to streamline the process of creating and publishing `R` driven presentations.

- Slidify is an almagamation of other technologies including knitr, Markdown, and several javascript libaries for HTML5 presentations.

- Slidify is infinitely extendable and customizable, yet it is easy to use!

- Slidify allows embedded code chunks and mathematical formulas which keeps your presentation reproducable.

- Slidify presentations are just HTML files, so you can view them with any web browser and share them easily on Github, Dropbox, or your own website.
